secondslidecontent = "Booking a study session is easy! Set up a session with a tutor up to 15 minutes in advance at a library or Starbucks, unlike traditional tutoring agencies or private tutors which have fixed schedules. Most of study material from tutoring agencies is not personalized to address a specific test or exam, StudyUp addresses this by providing personal tutoring service"

thirdslidecontent = "StudyUP App lets students form study circles in their own schools, libaries and communities. Underprivileged and inner city kids can easily access tutoring services by forming study circles and sharing knowledge. We are connecting the dots, there are underpriviledged students and there are volunteers ready to tutor."
