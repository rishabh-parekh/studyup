My name is Rishabh Parekh and I am a 16 year old student from West Bloomfield High School. I was inspired to create StudyUP through my experiences in High school. I realized many students, including myself face academic, work, and extracurricular challenges in school, and it impacted their school performance. This motivated me to create StudyUP, so I could make sure that learning has no limits and there is always a helping hand.
